# Hello, I'm Piotr! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer from GdaÅ„sk, Poland, with a rich background in programming and e-commerce solutions. I graduated from university where I studied computer science, and I now apply my skills to improve and innovate within the e-commerce industry.

I specialize in refining legacy code with modern web frameworks and delivering solutions that meet global customer demandsâ€”all within fast-paced sprint schedules. As a team player with a robust technical foundation, I thrive under pressure and am quick to adapt and learn.

Believing that "hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard," I continually seek opportunities to expand my knowledge. I also give back to the community as a university lecturer, where I teach the next generation of developers.

Thank you for visiting my profile. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!
